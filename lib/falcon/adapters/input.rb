			# read behaves like IO#read. Its signature is read([length, [buffer]]). If given, length must be a non-negative Integer (>= 0) or nil, and buffer must be a String and may not be nil.

When EOF is reached, this method returns nil if length is given and not nil, or “” if length is not given or is nil. If buffer is given, then the read data will be placed into buffer instead of a newly created String object.
